<h1>Me</h1>
<p>My corner of the web; for sharing code, ideas, and stuff that piques my interest.</p>

<h2>The site</h2>
<p>Is designed to be a personal dashboard that maintains itself.
  The contents of the <a href="#portfolio">portfolio</a> are pulled
  directly from Github and similarly the blog from my obsidian notes.
</p>
<p>
  This allows me to maintain a steady flow when working. Refining my notes as I go and tagging any polished articles as published.
</p>

<p>
  As for the technology used;
<ul>
  <li>~ HTML</li>
  <li>~ CSS</li>
  <li>~ vanilla JS</li>
  <li>~ C</li>
  <li>~ Bash</li>
</ul>
</br>
It's static and lightweight, going bare bones, with no bloat.
I wanted the snappy, no flicker feel of an SPA like application but without the overhead of external dependencies.
