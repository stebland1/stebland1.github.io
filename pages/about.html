<h2>Me</h2>
<p>My corner of the web; for sharing code, ideas, and stuff that piques my interest.</p>
<p>Work in progress ðŸš§</p>

<h2>the site</h2>
<p>it's designed to be a personal dashboard that maintains itself.
  the contents of the <a href="#portfolio">portfolio</a> are pulled
  directly from github and similarly the snippets (blog) from my obsidian notes.
</p>
<p>
  this allows me to maintain a steady flow when working. refining my notes as i go and tagging any polished articles as published.
</p>

<p>
  as for the technology used;
<ul>
  <li>~ HTML</li>
  <li>~ CSS</li>
  <li>~ vanilla JS</li>
</ul>
</br>
it's static and lightweight, going bare bones, with no bloat.
i wanted the snappy, no flicker feel of an SPA like application but without the overhead of an external dependency.
<p>
